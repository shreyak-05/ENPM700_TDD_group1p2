 * @brief PID controller implementation using the Pimpl idiom.

 * desired setpoint and a measured process variable, and applies a correction
 * based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms.
 * 
 * The implementation uses the Pimpl (Pointer to Implementation) idiom to
 * hide implementation details and reduce compilation dependencies.

 * @note This class is move-only (non-copyable).
